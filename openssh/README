This is a note to future maintainers about the patches for OpenSSH in this
directory.

# General notes

The mission when creating this patchset was to preserve enough of SunSSH's
behaviour and features to avoid serious problems for users upgrading to it from
SunSSH 1.5.

In particular, the PAM and RBAC behaviour of SunSSH had to be preserved, so that
login into roles, reduced privileges at login, and other features specific to
Illumos work correctly. The reason these don't work on stock upstream OpenSSH is
due to differences between our PAM and other PAM implementations -- openssh-
portable's PAM support is written primarily against Linux-PAM and OpenPAM.

Another key requirement was that stock SunSSH config files have to work
unmodified on the new replacement sshd, to avoid users being locked out by an
SSH daemon that can no longer start. SmartOS is a live distro, and has no
ability to "migrate" or "upgrade" user configuration files during a change of
version, so the SSH daemon has to be able to start using an old config file.
This is particularly true since zone images use their own config file. Any
current platform may still be used to run ancient images and the configs
in those images are expected to work.

PAM and configuration compatibility account for about half the patches applied
by count. The rest include some forward-ported features such as GSSAPI KeyEx
support, auditing changes, PubKeyPlugins, and use of privileges(5).

The patch files usually have some text in their commit messages (they are
serialised git commits) explaining their purpose and scope, which can be useful
to help understand things.

As an unfortunate side note, diff'ing SunSSH itself against OpenSSH is basically
impossible because of its hodge-podge merge history that has never been
publically released. Doing line-by-line comparisons to verify compatibility is
thus very challenging.

# Updating OpenSSH

Reconstitute the patches in the Patches/ directory into a git repo,
based on the tag in https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable that
matches up with that version. (Use git am for this)

Then you should be able to rebase onto a newer tag, merging as
needed.

The tarball in this directory is a clean checkout of the OpenSSH-portable
source without its configure script or any generated files. The
patches should only ever modify configure.ac and not configure, since
the Makefile here will regenerate configure using autoreconf.

NOTE: Some of these have been renumbered in Patches/ over time.

# Patches for upstreaming

Patch #21 relates to dropping Illumos privileges, and can probably be
eventually upstreamed (in a form modified to have some more `#ifdef`s, maybe a
`configure` arg).

Patches #22 (SMF) and maybe a cleaned up version of #28 (accept and send
LANG and LC_* variables) would also make decent candidates for upstreaming.

# Patches to be dropped eventually

The #29 and #32 patches, which sets `ssh-keygen` and `ssh-add` to the old
fingerprint behaviour and 'ssh-keygen' to PKCS#1 PEM, should be eventually
dropped once we're assured of not breaking SDC users. HEAD-2257 is probably
relevant.

#24 should be droppable once we figure out if we can move ssh keys back to
`/etc/ssh`, like the rest of the known world.

#23 and portions of #28 are moot because `sshd_config` for the global zone is
delivered from smartos-live, not the build here. And as mentioned above,
non-global zones have the config in the image.
