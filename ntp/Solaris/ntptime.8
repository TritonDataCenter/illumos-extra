.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This program is used to display or set the kernel variables used by NTP as described in the documentation at 
file:///usr/share/doc/ntp/kern.html entitled "A Kernel Model for Precision Timekeeping". A similar display can 
be obtained using the \fBntpdc\fP program and \fBkerninfo\fP command. The actual meaning of these variables
is rather difficult to understand, but the \fBntptime\fP program is primarily useful to determine if the variables
are set at all or to clear them if they are.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR "-c"
Display the time taken to call ntp_gettime (us)
.TP
.BR "-e \fIesterror\fP"
Set the estimated error, in microseconds.
.TP
.BR "-f \fIfrequency\fP"
Set the frequency error (-500 .. 500), in parts per million.
.TP
.BR "-h"
Display help information.
.TP
.BR "-m \fImaxerror\fP"
Set the maximum possible error, in microseconds.
.TP
.BR "-o \fIoffset\fP"
Set the offset in microseconds.
.TP
.BR "-r"
Print the unix and NTP time raw
.TP
.BR "-s \fIstatus\fP"
Set the status bits. Do not use this unless you know what you are doing.
.TP
.BR "-t \fItimeconstant\fP"
Set the log2 of PLL time constant, an integer in the range 0-10.
