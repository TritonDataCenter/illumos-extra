# We set _XOPEN_SOURCE=700 so that screen can access additional fields in
# struct msghdr. pkgsrc also does this.
#
# Screen always tries to use libutempter when it sees the libutemtper
# header file. The current version of autoconf in screen also tries to link
# the tests it runs against libutempter which can fail if the build system
# doesn't have libutempter. We add the proto /usr/lib to work around this
# while running configure (OS-8171).

#
# It is important to make sure that screen has a prefix of /usr. When screen
# builds and prefix is not set, it runs which screen to determine the prefix. On
# the first build, this means that you will probably get /usr/bin/screen.
# However, on subsequent builds, you will get the one from the proto area. Even
# worse, if PATH were ever pathological, you could potentially get
# /opt/local/bin which would be terrible.
