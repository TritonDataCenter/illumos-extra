# Node's build system is super broken.  If we pass it LIBS at configure time,
# it ignores it.  If we pass it LIBS at make time, it completely replaces all
# libraries, including those the build system itself would normally add.
# So our only option is to add this to LDFLAGS, which has to be passed at
# build time... including for the install target, because the generated
# makefiles have missing dependencies and rebuild stuff when installing.
# This has to be the most complicated, baroque, pointlessly wrong way
# imaginable to build something with a few dozen source files.  The next time
# you are here reading this and trying to work around the next piece of
# Node build stupidity, just stop.  Rip all this out, write a simple makefile,
# and copy it in at unpack time like we do for bzip2.
