Starting with 2.13.8, we're pulling source tarfiles from the GNOME project's

	https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/releases

We're pulling the .tar.gz file from the appropriate release, and running a
full `autoreconf -fi` on it. This matches what other illumos distros do, and
even in the strap build it works.

Because we're pulling it from their gitlab, we're using their git tag v2.13.8
in VER.  The official releases have autoconf already run, and decompress
bigger than the source-only tarfiles we pull from the above site.

If the source of tarfiles changes, or other tarfile-related changes occur,
this README should be updated.
